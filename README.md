# TikTok’s Data Collection Causes Security and Privacy Risks Debate in the US
In this document, I discuss two articles about TikTok’s Data Collection Causes Security and Privacy Risks Debate in the US and the claims made by some that it is a security and privacy threat to users and the nation.  I present and discuss two opposing views on this important matter.

## Article 1
In Spiceworks's [There’s Nothing Confusing About TikTok’s Security Risks](https://www.npr.org/2018/03/20/595338116/what-did-cambridge-analytica-do-during-the-2016-election), 

## Article 2
Contrary to the claims made in Spiceworks's piece on the issue, Forbes's [TikTok Shouldn’t Be The Center Of The U.S. Data Privacy Debate](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2023/08/01/tiktok-shouldnt-be-the-center-of-the-us-data-privacy-debate/?sh=5a9a76ac39b0)
