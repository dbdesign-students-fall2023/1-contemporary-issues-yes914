# TikTok’s Data Collection Causes Security and Privacy Risks Debate in the US
In this document, I discuss two articles about TikTok’s Data Collection Causes Security and Privacy Risks Debate in the US and the claims made by some that it is a security and privacy threat to users and the nation.  I present and discuss two opposing views on this important matter.

## Article 1
In Spiceworks's [There’s Nothing Confusing About TikTok’s Security Risks](https://www.npr.org/2018/03/20/595338116/what-did-cambridge-analytica-do-during-the-2016-election), explained and expressed national security concerns with China's involvement in TikTok.

The power of TikTok's acquisition of personally identifiable information (PII), digital data, and biometric identifiers is particularly concerning. It also reveals that TikTok stores user data outside of the United States, raising worries about its possible access by Chinese-based employees or even the Chinese government.

Moreover, China's exploitation of data as a national resource adds to the perceived danger. In 2019, the Chinese government declared data a national resource, seeing it as an economic, political, and geopolitical asset. TikTok's huge data-collecting approaches may be compatible with this strategy, which raises worries that the data may be utilized for reasons other than the platform, affecting national security and international relations.



## Article 2
Contrary to the claims made in Spiceworks's piece on the issue, Forbes's [TikTok Shouldn’t Be The Center Of The U.S. Data Privacy Debate](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2023/08/01/tiktok-shouldnt-be-the-center-of-the-us-data-privacy-debate/?sh=5a9a76ac39b0) advocates for a broader view of data privacy, emphasizing that the focus should not be on foreign entities like TikTok.  Not just TikTok, but other tech companies in the US are also tapping into consumer data. The article argues that data privacy is a human right that should be protected regardless of the platform's origin.

As a consequence, the article calls for broad data privacy regulations at both the federal and business levels. It recommends that the federal government establish comprehensive data privacy legislation, citing models such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (CPPA) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), both of which have robust privacy regulations. Furthermore, it emphasizes the significance of such legislation in establishing consistent data protection rules in the United States.
